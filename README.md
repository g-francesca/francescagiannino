## 👋 Hello world! I'm Francesca

- 🏢 I'm currently working as a **UI Software Engineer** at **[ViacomCBS](https://viacbs.com)**
- 👉 My goal is to build clean and reusable UI, while producing readable, scalable and maintainable code.
- ⏳ I spend most of my time working with **React.js**, **CSS-in-JS**, **Jest and Enzyme**, **Storybook**, **Accessibility tools**
- 🔭 I'm willing to dig more into **Next.js**, **GraphQL**, **Apollo**
- ✍️ Sometimes, **[I write about tech](https://medium.com/@fuladuf)** and **[I play with code just for fun](https://codepen.io/gfrancesca)**

## When I'm not coding, guess what I'm doing:
- 🍻 chilling with friends
- 😺 cuddling a fluffy kitten
- 🚀 planning my next trip in the space
- 📺 wathing movies / TV series to play a second life
- 💸 spending too much money for usless stuff
- 📰 reading newspapers and then repenting it
- 🍝 pretending to be a master chef
- 🗻 pretending to be a professional hiker
- ⛵ pretending to be a captain
